# NessusVulnerabilityScanner

### Description
This project involves installing Nessus Essentials Vulnerability scanner on my host machine, and scanning a fresh install of Windows 10 to see what it finds as vulnerabilities. I will then install a very old and insecure software to see what it finds, before remediating some of the listed vulnerabilities and seeing how the scan turns out next. In the project, I will be intentionally making the host very vulnerable because this isn't a penetration test lab where I am trying to break in. This simulates me having full control over the environment and wanting to find all the vulnerabilities I can, so that way if someone is able to break in somehow, there is a smaller attack surface.

### Environments Used
- **Windows 10**
- **Nessus Essentials**
- **VMware Workstation**

### Virtual Machine setup

This lab assumes knowledge of setting up a Windows 10 VM in VMware. We just need to select "bridged" as the network connection and select my host's adapter.

Once my VM is up and running, I try to ping it from my host machine, which should work because they are on the same private network.

It doesn't work because the firewall is on. So, we go to the firewall settings and turn them all off.

Now the VM accepts my pings.

This is the general screen for a basic network scan in Nessus Essentials. There are multiple videos online to go through all the steps for installing the software. I just need to put in the IP of my VM to tell it where to scan.

After it does its first scan, we can see that it really didn't show much, which is strange because this is a fresh Windows 10 install with no updates.

To allow Nessus to get more in-depth scans, we need to configure a few things. First, we need to go to services and turn on the Remote Registry.

Next, we need to make sure all network file and print sharing is turned on.

We then need to set "never Notify" on the User Account Control.

Finally, we need to create this registry in this location and set it to 1. You should never take these steps on a machine you are using; we are only doing it because this machine is not on a domain, so I have to make it accept the scanner.

After making those changes, we do a restart and another scan. Now that the machine is letting the vulnerability scan go deeper, we find many more vulnerabilities and suggested remediations.

Now, to give it more to look at, we will install a very old and insecure version of Firefox.

We run the scan again, and we have way more vulnerabilities than we did before.

Now we remediate! In this scenario, we decide we don't want to allow Firefox, so we remove it entirely (risk avoidance). We then run the Windows Update utility a few times.

After removing Firefox and running Windows Update, we are already much better off than we were just a few minutes ago.

### Conclusion
For this lab, we will stop here, but in a production environment, we would continue on with the policy the company has set in place. Some organizations don't even look at low to medium threats, and some will want us to go through each of these items to verify whatever is said is within our acceptable level of risk. Thanks for following along!
